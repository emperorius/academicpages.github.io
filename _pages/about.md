I am a biophysicist aiming to model biological systems such as the brain, xylems, proteins, sperms, based on simple physical principles. My background is mainly in statistical physics, computational neuroscience and optimization, with a strong interdisciplinary experience.

In particular, my research experience has been in Pareto optimization applied in proteins and human behaviors, and in whole-brain modeling in healthy and disease brains.
